Nikita Mazepin might be bringing a healthy chunk of budget with him to the Haas team, but don’t be fooled into thinking he hasn’t also got the driving chops to go with it.

The Russian – the fourth to compete in F1 after Vitaly Petrov, Sergey Sirotkin and Daniil Kvyat – has an impressive CV in the junior formulas, finishing runner-up in the 2018 GP3 championship with four race wins.

And after taking his time to find his feet in his first season of F2 in 2019, he came into his own in 2020, notching up six podiums – including two victories – on his way to fifth in the standings.

Haas boss Guenther Steiner has described Mazepin as a “mature racer” and he is likely to need all that maturity in 2021 as he drives for the American team in motorsport’s top tier.
